			"FractalPoint": "A curious little friend. Direct contact may result in complete obliteration, so tread with caution. Its nature as a fractal entity becomes frighteningly apparent when observing its reproductive capability...",
			"FractalSpirit": "An apex predator of the Fractal Dimension, it’s overwhelming speed and relentless assault is a good motivator for keeping a low profile in its native habitat.",
			"MegaMenger": "A mechanical organism seemingly bound to the four cardinal directions. Its surface area appears to be infinite, and within this infinity lies an immense amount of energy. It relentlessly hunts weakened prey with its predictable but fatal methods of locomotion, invariably sapping its victim of all energy.",
			"Amphisbaena": "Perhaps the most familiar life form amongst the overwhelmingly alien biosphere of the Fractal Dimension. Double the heads means double the danger however, meaning it offers little comfort to weary adventurers.",
			"SparkCrawler": "One of the many uncanny creatures inhabiting the Fractal Dimension, this one prefers locomotion by latching onto surrounding strands with its four extendable hooks.",
			"FractalFern": "It’s debatable whether this entity categorizes as an animal or a plant. It’s firmly rooted in place, yet spontaneously warps to different locations, and it seems to possess some form of special awareness.",
			"Euryopter": "A hovering arthropod-like lifeform, it is reminiscent of long extinct creatures. On close inspection, its claws appear to branch endlessly down in scale...",
			"Sparkfly": "A surprisingly mundane bug found high in the fractal skies, its abdomen contains a mote of dendritic energy that blinks in strange sequences to communicate. Just don't look too closely...",
			"FractusSpore": "When a fractus reaches maturity, it begins to produce these strange hopping creatures, which rove the wastes looking for a spot to lay root and grow. Plant, animal, or something more? Another mystery of the fractals...",
			"FrondBud": "A juvenile Fractal Frond that has not yet developed any offensive capabilities, its instinctual teleportation nonetheless allows it to avoid predators and reach maturity.",
			"Instability": "A localized tear in the space-time continuum, found at the upper edges of the world. Harmless on its own, but who knows what lurks within?",
			"SelfsimilarSentinel": "Even the metal in the Fractal Dimension has rudimentary sentience, assembling into this machine-like form to defend itself from assault not of its own kind. A dizzying array of fractal attacks awaits any would-be miners...",
			"RiftDenizen": "This terrifying alien creature emerged from the rift between worlds! It hovers out of reach, opening more portals to launch attacks through; target these to fight back!",
			"ChaosCrawler": "The ruler of the fractal wastes' caverns, an alien arthropod that uses its infinite fractal tail to lash and constrict prey. It only targets weakened adventurers, so only fools or worthy challengers may encounter it.",
			"Orthoconic": "This massive mollusc is the apex predator of the fractal depths, attracted to weakened travellers for easy prey. Look out for its repeating shell!",
			"Shockflake": "As if dendritic energy wasn't perilous enough, now it's come alive! It haphazardly whirls through the fractal skies, launching electrical bolts to defend its territory.",
			"TurbulenceSpark": "A chaotic well of fractal energy, barely keeping itself stable with the water's pressure. Any disruption will send it careening towards the source, disrupting logical momentum with its alien forces.",
			"SeaAnomaly": "Don't let its terrestrial appearance fool you, this fractal creature is as deadly as any other, launching rays of energy to fry unlucky divers.",
			"BisectorHead": "Creatures found deep in the fractal wastes, they tunnel at high speed through the porous caves and cleave prey in two at the atomic level with their infinitely sharp exoskeletons.",
			"DustSprite": "Animate particulates inhabiting the barren fractal deserts, they attack by swarming targets and overwhelming their senses. May entitle you to financial compensation if inhaled.",
			"FractalSlimeLarge": "A slime in name only, this fractal ooze ricochets freely around the alien landscape and splits when attacked. Watch out for the perfect corner bounce!",

			"Rattler": "This small, venomous snake prefers dry climates. It loudly rattles to ward off any predators, but it’s just too cute to avoid!",
			"Zombat": "There are bats, there are zombies. Sometimes, there are zombie bats. This feeble creature does its best to perform its batty duties in spite of its zombification.",
			"BloodBat": "Even the bats are riled up from the horrible energy of the Blood Moon! Upon being exposed to its red light, cave dwelling bats become permanently warped.",
			"NestGuardian": "Utilizing powerful venom, it bites anyone who approaches. In its dying moments, it unleashes its adorable, but nonetheless harmful offspring onto the world.",
			"StarConstruct": "With violently flinging chained hooks and blood-curdling shrieks, this entity blurs the line between organic and automaton.",
			"StellatedSlime": "Having absorbed a fallen star, this slime leaps high in the sky to pounce on unsuspecting bystanders. Performing such leaps is considered a sign of greatness in the slime community.",
			"GreatStellatedSlime": "It’s bigger, it’s greater, it’s... much the same as its smaller counterpart, safe for the rain of falling stars it unleashes at its prey.",
			"CloudCichlid": "These small, fish-like creatures are composed entirely of clouds and swim through the rainy skies as if they were water.",
			"StormcloudCichlid": "Composed of dark, stormy clouds, these fish-like creatures feed on airborne bacteria brought down from the skies in raindrops.",
			"Gemfly": "Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground...",
			"Gigabat": "Reinforced with its own posse of bat companions, this positively enormous bat employs echolocation and its overwhelming numbers to hunt.",
			"GigabatMinion": "A single pawn utilized by Gigabat. As soon as one falls, another takes its place, as if nothing had happened at all.",
			"BatSlime": "Is it a bat, is it a slime? It doesn’t matter! It occasionally sprouts wings for greatly enhanced locomotion, at least by slime standards.",
			"Ghostwriter": "A friendly specter, she prefers spending her endless free time reading and writing her very own literature. She’s rather sociable, as being able to slip through walls opens up many avenues for gossip.",
			"Spitter": "With accuracy more comparable to a soldier than any snake, this hooded cobra spits streams of foul venom from afar.",
			"BrineFly": "Individually harmless, in large clouds they prove a dizzying nuisance. Some organisms get their entire water intake from eating these flies in large quantities!",
			"Mussel": "Fortified with a hard shell, the Mussel waits for an opportune time to fling pearls to attack! They also have dozens of eyes on the edge of their shells.",
			"Salthopper": "A specialized slime with high halotolerance, the Salthopper can rapidly sap any adventurer of bodily moisture.",
			"BrineDweller": "These salt-encrusted fish normally feed on the microscopic shrimp that flourish in their briny habitat, but they won't turn down bigger prey.",
			"StalagBeetle": "Not true beetles, but alkali spirits which have taken to encasing themselves in limestone for protection.",
			"AlkaliSpirit": "An animated mass of floating alkaline fluid that dwells in the limestone caves. While soft, goopy, and vulnerable, it corrodes anything it touches.",
			"FlowWorm": "These stretched-out alkali spirits smoothly burrow their way through the rock, rapidly eroding anything in their path.",
			"GlowWorm": "Dangling amongst the stalactites of cave ceilings, their lights cast an eerie glow that their insect prey find irresistible.",
			"Limeshell": "With its vulnerable eye protected by a tough multi-layered shell, the Limeshell comfortably flings itself at whatever it pleases.",
			"Alkalabomination": "A twisted mass of alkaline spirits fused together into a single incoherent being. Quite unstable, it is prone to breaking up when damaged.",
			"Slimey": "A seemingly-placid grazer of the microbes that grow in the limestone caves, this odd snail reacts with great fury to any disturbance.",
			"SeaSerpent": "An inhabitant of the coral reefs, this aquatic snake packs a brutal venom capable of killing whatever it bites. It’s not above sinking its fangs into humans, either.",
			"Kraken": "Powerful tentacles allow this large cephalopod to stand up against creatures of similar size. It can quickly jet towards any prey using its siphon.",
			"ConeShell": "This unassuming snail packs a deadly secret; a harpoon-like needle it can launch to inject its prey (and unaware swimmers) with its life threatening venom.",
			"SeaLily": "Rooted into the ground, these creatures wave pleasantly in the ocean current. They may not exactly look the part, but they’re related to starfish and sea urchins!",
			"Sunfish": "These notably large fish have a bizarre body plan, but pose no threat to adventurers. They’re easy pickings for parasites and other aquatic predators, however...",
			"Pegasus": "The unicorn's opposite and equal... but still just as angry. The Sun Knights' mount of choice, its magic allows its wings to support its heavy body and soar through the air freely.",
			"IlluminantScourer": "An advanced illuminant slime, blessed with hovering and crystal manipulation abilities. It flies overhead, launching deadly beams of light that are reflected down onto its targets.",

			"Aequorean": "Once a common jellyfish touched by the Hallow's blessing, it swims through air and water with equal grace and launches prismatic reflections of itself to confuse and distract.",
			"SunKnight": "Members of an elite order of hallowed warriors that serve the Empress's rule. They attack with precise leaps and spinning blades to make the sun set on any would-be corrupters.",
			"Trailblazer": "This unique subspecies of pixie leaves a long trail of holy plasma behind itself as it moves, which it happily weaponizes to rope in foes.",
			"Painbow": "An advanced type of pixie that has learned to separate its light into the colors of the spectrum. It fights with rainbow surges and charges, every shade equally painful.",
			"SunPixie": "Radiating intense heat with hallowed magic and solar energy, the Sun Pixie is frantic in its pursuit of absolute purification. It is said, however, that even this most luminous of beings has an inner darkness.",
			"Uraraneid": "This creature belongs to a higher caliber than the typical arachnids that dot the Crimson. Using the ichor stored in its large swollen bulb, it can rapidly inflate its legs with the fluid, propelling itself great distances.",
			"Crimago": "Soaring about on fell wings, this living nightmare hunts with its scythe-like claws. Close inspection reveals their claws to be literal bone matter erupting from their flesh... yet the Crimago cares not, the Crimson has long since stolen the sensation of true pain from all of its children.",
			"LightEater": "If the Eater of Souls truly did consume souls, logically Light Eaters similarly consume light. This would explain their near ineffable hunting strategy of conjuring illusional copies of themselves.",
			"TendrilAmalgam": "What is seen above ground is but a small piece of an even larger unseen hivemind, linked underground through a complex network of tendrils. It breaches from the soil and rubble to search for unassimilated mass with its many uncoordinated eyes.",
			"LivingSpine": "No biomass goes to waste in the Crimson, even bones belonging to long since decayed bodies are welcomed into the Crimson’s collective. As such, even solitary spines dutifully burrow through the blood caked earth, expanding their region’s territory.",
			"RavenousCursed": "The favorite spawns of the Corruption are no doubt the worms it frequently births. Dreadful fire surges through its body as if it were blood.",
			"Esophage": "Empowered with all that is evil, this gargantuan parasite stalks the land in search of a host. Without a source of vitality to empower it, it cannot be truly considered either alive or dead.",
			"ConvectiveWanderer": "This immense magma-dweller can tolerate the extreme temperatures of the Earth's core, using its tentacle-like gills both to drill through solid metal and to protect is more vulnerable head. Highly protective of its much smaller offspring.",
			"BabyWanderer": "Unable to tolerate hotter temperatures at this age, the first part of their lives is spent in the Earth's upper mantle. They may seem vulnerable, but rarely is anything in nature truly defenseless.",
			"GraniteCrawler": "An unsettling amalgamate of granite molded into a familiar shape, it scurries across the caves at high speed while shielding its vulnerable core-eye from damage.",
			"GraniteStomper": "A construct of granite enclosing a brilliant but fragile refractive crystal, the stomper shelters within its pillar-like legs, only emerging to fend off threats.",
			"HydraBody": "The legendary beast appears at last! Remove one head, and two more will take its place... or you could simply take out the body supporting them instead.",
			"InfernalArrow": "Empowered by the fiery will of beings that dwell below even the underworld, this animated chunk of rock pursues any trespassers that enter its infernal abode.",
			"MantleOWar": "This strange creature may look like a bizarre, molten jellyfish, but in fact it is a colonial organism made up of numerous smaller units called zooids.",
			"StormCloudfish": "A rather aggressive, predatory life form composed entirely of turbulent thunder clouds. It employs rain clouds to drench its foes, and even uses lightning as a last resort."
